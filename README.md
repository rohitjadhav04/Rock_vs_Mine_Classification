# Rock_vs_Mine_Classification

If one States submarine going through ocean to its enemy sea area and that submarine wants to know that the object under the submarine is Rock or Mine ie. Explosives 
Here I have worked on data which has collected from the Sonar system which is setup into the Ship and used to detect obstacles beneath the ship.
How did I collected this data?
- In laboratory, Experiment has done where the sonar is used to send and receive signals bounced back from metal cylinder and some rocks and then Data has been collected.
In this Small project I have perform following steps to find whether object is rock or mine:-
STEP 1 :-  Importing the Dependencies
STEP 2 :-  Data collection and data pre-processing
STEP 3 :-  Separate the lable and other data
STEP 4 :-  Train Test split
Step 5 :-  Applied Logistic Regression Algorithm(Which is better for binary classification)
STEP 6 :-  Train the model
STEP 7 :-  Find accuracy of training data by using Accuracy metric.
STEP 8 :-  Find test accuracy
STEP 9 :-  Finally make predective system to find object is rock or mine.
